This theme is perfect for writers and artists. \"Anarcho Notepad\" can be easily customised and already translated to different languages. It utilises latest HTML-5, CSS-3, PHP and WordPress native functions for creating the awesomeness that looks good on every browser. I’m constantly adding new features to this theme to allow you to personalise it to your own needs. If you want a new feature or just want to be able to change something just ask me and I would be happy to add it. I'm glad to present you the Most Anarchist WP-Theme Of All! Enjoy!\r\n\r\n## Copyrights for Resources used in this theme.\r\n\r\n\tI) Font-Awesome Icons are under the MIT Licnese. http://fontawesome.io\r\n\tII) Font Name \"Forum\" are under the SIL Open Font License v1.1.\r\n\tIII) The Default Background Image (images/background.jpg) is under public domain: http://wallbox.ru/wallpaper/9422/#.UnLDFNQhCRs\r\n\tIV) The images notepad-back.gif, pages-back.gif, pages-bottom.gif, postit-back.gif, postit-upper.gif, recent-posts-bottom.gif are under the General Public License. http://www.evaneckard.com/\r\n\tV) The images anarchy-symbol-big.jpg, anarchy-symbol.jpg and anarchy-symbol.png is under public domain: http://www.layoutsparks.com/1/213916/anarchy-perfect-black-A-31000.html\r\n\tVI) The images links_box.gif, about_box.gif, line.gif, outer-back.png, outer-back-search.png and notepad-bottom.png has been created by me and under GPLv3 license.\r\n\tVII) The file html5.js present in the \"/js\" folder are under the MIT/GPL2 Licnese. https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv\r\n\tVIII) The files theme-customizer.js and smoothscroll.js present in the \"/js\" folder has been created by me and under the GPLv3 Licnese.\r\n        IX) The file follow.png in the \"/images\" folder are under the Creative Commons License.
